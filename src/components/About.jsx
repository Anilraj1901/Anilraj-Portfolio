			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<h4>Hi, My name is Anilraj</h4>
			<p>
				I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience in building and maintaining web applications. I specialize in JavaScript and have worked extensively with Node.js, Express.js, and modern front-end technologies to deliver responsive, scalable, and performance-driven solutions.

				Throughout my journey, I’ve developed RESTful APIs, integrated databases, handled authentication and authorization, and implemented real-time features. I’m comfortable working across the entire development lifecycle — from designing architecture to deploying and maintaining applications.

				While I haven't yet worked with technologies like GraphQL, Docker, or TypeScript, I’m actively expanding my skill set and looking forward to applying these tools in future projects.

				I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and continuously learning to improve my craft. I'm skilled in building high-performance, scalable applications with a focus on real-time tracking, geospatial data visualization, and API development. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and optimizing web performance.
